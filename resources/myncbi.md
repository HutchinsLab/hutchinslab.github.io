Getting your papers from MyNCBI into iCite

I've been asked about how best to move the papers in one's MyNCBI profile into iCite, so I've put together a resource to help out with that. **You don't have to do this yourself--if you have a delegate help out with managing your MyNCBI profile, they can also follow these steps without even logging in**

Step 1: Visit your public MyNCBI profile (this needs to be enabled in your MyNCBI settings). Here's mine for an example: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/bruce%20ian.hutchins.1/bibliography/public/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/bruce%20ian.hutchins.1/bibliography/public/)

Step 2: 
Click the selection checkbox above the article table to select all articles:
![Select all](/assets/myncbi1.png)

Step 3:
Click the "Manage citations" button:
![Manage citations](/assets/myncbi2.png)

Step 4:
Click "Export file (PMID)"
![Export File PMID](/assets/myncbi3.png)

Step 5:
After the file opens, go to iCite at [https://icite.od.nih.gov](https://icite.od.nih.gov)

Step 6:
Click the "New Analysis" button on top:
![New Analysis at iCite](/assets/myncbi4.png)

Step 7:
Either click the "Browse" button under the "Upload a spreadsheet of PMIDs" button and select the file that you exported from MyNBCI, **or** open that file up, select all the PMIDs, copy them, and paste them into the box labeled "Input a list of PMIDs"

Step 8:
You should see data visualizations and statistics about your papers. If you want to create a sharable link that you can bookmark, clicke the "Export" button:
![Export sharable link](/assets/myncbi6.png)

Step 9:
Click "Shareable link"
![Export sharable link](/assets/myncbi7.png)

Step 10:
Click "Copy" to copy it to your clipboard. You can visit that URL and bookmark it, share it with people, etc. Be sure to re-generate a new link with your new papers when you update your MyNCBI bibliography!
